                    <h1>Some statistics from my poker homegame</h1>
                    <p>
                        For some reason, I'm the bookkeeper for my friend group's poker night. Since I've been brushing up on my SQL recently, I thought it'd be a good 
                        exercise to create a database for our records. Once I had done that, it felt natural to compile a few statistics from our games (mostly using Pandas). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before getting into that, though, some disclaimers: while our game has been going off and on for nearly 4 years now (wow! time flies), these stats are just from late 2021 to the start of 2023. 
                        I decided on these dates because sometime in mid-2021 we settled all the running debts (though I might go back sometime and include them just out of curiosty). For a little
                        while after that, my record taking was pretty terrible, but I managed to get a little back on track after a couple months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who don't play poker, an important thing to keep in mind is that the sample size here is abysmally small. It might sound like 19 sessions over a year and a bit 
                        would yield some good data, but the variance in poker is so extreme that drawing even the most basic conclusion is risky; for instance, though I don't 
                        track total number of hands played, I'd guess that we average something like 50 hands an hour, and a session is roughly 2 hours long, so the sample size is around 2000 hands.
                        Most experts recommend a sample of at least 10,000 hands to draw any sort of conclusion about whether you are a winning player or not, and more like 50,000 to estimate winrates
                        and other more specific stats.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Net Won
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Ok, here's what we're fundamentally interested in: the net amount won, tracked over all 19 sessions:
                    </p>
                    <figure class="trip-figure">

                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        In conjunction with my performance from games prior to mid-2021, I think it's safe to say I'm a winning player in this pool. To emphasize how swingy this game can be, 'PL' was in the top 3
                        for winnings from the previous series of games and is still net up. The final tally in tabular form is this:

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>PL</td> <td>-63.61</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>
                        I also though it'd be interesting to take a look at the standard deviation:
                    </p>
                    <figure class="trip-figure">
                        <img src="../../images/std.png">

                    </figure>
                    <p class="lastPara">
                        Gotta say, this one really aligns with my preconcieved about how we play. Maybe it's just a cooincidence, but the player LA plays extremely conservatively, and DG is extremely loose.
                        It seems to lend credence to the idea that one can strongly control the variance in poker by adjusting one's style.
