                    <p class="subhead"> 
                        I've been occupied making preparations for a big upcoming trip (more on that later!), so it's been a while since my last blog post. Just recently I finished listening to a super interesting podcast: <a class="link" href="https://features.apmreports.org/sold-a-story/">Sold a Story</a>, a series about education research and the politics thereof. I recommend you give it a listen too! A few months back I also 
                        came across <a class="link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-education/the-rise-and-fall-of-vibes-based-literacy">this New Yorker article</a>, which goes over much the same topic. For some reason both of these reminded me of a pet-peeve of mine &mdash; not about education, but 
                        rather a different field which suffers from a similar absence of empirical study: animal speeds.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        The Disappointing Reality of Animal Speeds
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Obviously this is nowhere near as important as literacy, but it still grinds my gears that there are virtually no experiments which determine the top speed of the various fauna of the world. More concerningly, many people will authoritatively state what they 
                        think the top speeds are, despite the utter lack of evidence. For instance, a cursory google search for "black bear speed" reveals page after page of websites listing various speeds, and I have yet 
                        to find a single one that actually had a justification for their number; it doesn't even have to be a peer reviewed journal! I would gladly accept a video recording with some analysis or maybe a radar gun measurement, but apparently even this is too much to ask for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first started thinking about this years ago when I came across an article that claimed African Elephants could run at 45 kph. This immediately set off alarm bells to me; it just sounded unreasonable. But looking around the internet, there are loads 
                        of sites that spit out similar numbers. Digging around, I came across <a class="link" href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/213/5/694/10070/Biomechanics-of-locomotion-in-Asian-elephants">this</a> study, wherein researchers got dozens of elephants to run as fast as possible to study their gait.
                        The max speed they recorded? 18 kph. Now I imagine skeptics will point out that that number may be artificially low: for one, they used Asian elephants, and secondly they have limited tools to impel the elephants to go as fast as possible because of ethical considerations (i.e. 
                        they can't get the elephants to sprint like their lives depend on it). While I am highly doubtful that the larger African elephants are substantially faster (Asian Elephants are plenty big already!)<a class="footnote" id="top1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, the latter objection seems reasonable. That being said, people are generally quite clever at 
                        motivating animals, so I would guess the measured speeds are close to the max.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As out-of-whack as the elephant numbers are, it actually gets worse: there are dozens upon dozens of 'fun-fact' animal websites that claim that the North American Alligator 
                        can reach speeds over 55 kph. Unfortunately, no one seems to have actually carried out a systematic study of alligator speeds, so I can't point to actual science to show how absurd those numbers are. 
                        However some substantially saner estimates from the University of Florida put their top speed between 10 and 18 kph (no source given in the article I found, so still take it with a grain of salt).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the flip side, there are a handful of animal speeds that we actually do have evidence for: notably, race-horses have been measured at over 70 kph (over a quarter mile from a standing start, so their instantaneous top speed is faster still!). Similary, the fastest greyhound ever recorded ran 
                        400 yards at an average of 67 kph. And a Cheetah in the Cinncinati zoo has been recorded running at 98 kph (instantaneous speed, so not a standing start). Finally, of course we have a pretty good idea of what humans are capable of over nearly every conceivable distance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Where do These Numbers Come From?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Since few to none of the articles one finds on the internet about animal speeds actually give sources (and when they do, it is usually to some book of animal facts that in turn gives no sources), one wonders where 
                        these numbers are coming from. My idle speculation is that there is a lot of wild guessing going on: some early researcher goes out to observe ostriches or something, sees 'em run really fast, and says "wow, that must have been like 80 kph!". But frankly, I have very 
                        little faith in peoples ability to guess speeds by eye. For instance, <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB10PxYwZo0">here</a> is a video of an ostrich running. If it weren't for the caption, I personally could have guessed a speed anywhere between 40 and 80 kph &mdash; 
                        I just don't have a good sense of speed, especially from that side-view perspective. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That brings me to a related point: people's sense of speed is likely warped by motor vehicles. As an example, a friend of mine likes to surprise people by asking them what they think the length of the yellow dashed lines on highways are. Before you look it up, see if you can guess what it is. How about the distance between the dashes? In general
                        your perspective from the seat of a car probably does not translate well to other perspectives. If you have only experienced 50 kph while inside a car, you might not realize just how fast it really is. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, there's likely some social factors at play here as well. Nobody is gonna be wowed by the claim that alligators can run at 10 kph. But if you hear that they can run as fast as 
                        55 kph, you might find that interesting enough to spread it. And for things like bears or hippos, there's an added motivation for park officials to hype up the danger: given that a shockingly large number of people are delusional 
                        about their physical abilities (see that poll about 12% of men who think they could score a point of Serena Williams, or <a class="link" href="https://www.outkick.com/reality-you-cant-run-a-sub-50-forty-022414/">this article about the 40 yard dash</a>) I can kinda sympathize with the bear safety experts who claim that black bears can run 
                        over 50 kph. Even if it turns out black bears can only run at 30 kph (probably an underestimate), you still can't outrun them &mdash; I am fairly speedy and have only hit 30 a handful of times, on a track with plenty of warmup and a running start.
                    </p>
                    <h2>A Related Note About Humans</h2>
                    <p>
                        While I'm on this general subject, yet another animal fact that I take issue with is the claim that humans are uniquely good at distance running. For one, humans are definitely not the best distance runners: the 100 mile record for horses is well under 6 hours, which is faster than 4 minute mile pace. Even under the most human biased-conditions possible for the man vs. horse marathon, the horses usually win... 
                        and that's with a person on the horse's back! Hopefully I've made it clear that we really don't know much about animal speeds, so even the weaker claim that humans are among the best distance runners simply doesn't have any evidence for it. It seems that this claim is usually brought up with the claim that 
                        humans used to be persistence hunters, which may or may not be true; it seems to be fairly controversial among anthropologist (I'm no expert here; it could be totally fringe or just about mainstream, but it's definitely not settled).
                    </p>
                    <h2>A Parting Note</h2>
                    <p>
                        I have seen the inside of academia, and know firsthand how many esoteric, arcane questions people have spent lifetimes studying. Surely if we can figure out the exact neural structure of <em>c. elegans</em>, we can spare a few bucks to find out how fast 
                        giraffes run? C'mon, man, I wanna know!
                    </p>
                    <p class ="footnote" id="footnote-1">
                        <sup><a href="#top1" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup> It's another pet peeve of mine that people think larger humans are faster too; it's simply not true. With the notable exception of Usain Bolt, most Olympic sprinters 
                        are close to average height (and there are more than a few who are quite short: <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelly-Ann_Fraser-Pryce">e.g. Shelly-Ann Faser-Pryce</a>), and distance runners tend to be shorter than average.
